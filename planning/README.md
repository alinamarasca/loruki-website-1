# Communication Schedule

[comment]: <> (When and how often will you meet? what will you discuss at these meetings? ...)
We will meet whenever necessary and circumstances permit. On some occasions, a single member may be available to communicate with the member requesting communication, and both may solve any questions or difficulties.

## Communication Channels

[comment]: <> (As a team come up with a plan for how to use each communication channel. What will you discuss on each one? How often will you get in touch on each channel? Below is a starter list of different ways to communicate, go ahead and rewrite this list so it works for your team:)

**Planning Documents:**
    
**Slack Messaging:**  Continually. It is important to know in what stage of the project the rest of the team is working; Furthermore, if any of the members of the group has any request, doubt or question, it should be addressed first by the group before moving on to another instance.
    
**Video Calls:** As scheduled by the team. We will have at least two (2) video calls a week to track our progress.

**Issues:**
    
**Pull Requests:** Every day there must be at least one (1) Pull Request for each group member.

## Availability

[comment]: <> (How many hours does everyone have? and when are you generally available?)
Of course, it depends on the activities of each member, but it is important to know the availability of each one. This information is provided by each member and is never imposed on the group, however the active participation of all members is necessary.

- Victoria: hours/dasy
- Fatih: hours/day
- Gustavo: 5 hours/ day ( 8:00 - 18:00)
- Reinaldo: 5 hours/day


## Asking for Help

[comment]: <> (There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:
0 -> 30 min: Try on your own
30 -> 60 min: Ask your group for help
60+ min: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub)

-  0 -> 60 min: Try on your own
- 60 -> 90 min: Ask your group for help
- 90+ min: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
